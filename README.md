## Reflection
This was my first custom project. The project goal was to create a single page application customized for a small cleaning company.   

This project focus especially on styling.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Redux, Bootstrap, ReactStrap, ReactScroll, ReactContextMenu and a significant amount of CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
